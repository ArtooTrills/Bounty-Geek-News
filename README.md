A project based task for a fullstack JS Ninja. An enhanced version of HackerNews. Solve this and get to work at Artoo

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. In general, content that can be submitted is defined as "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"

It has everything from high quality tech articles, entrepreneurial stories, job postings and some cool indie developer project show-offs. It is similar to Reddit where you can upvote or downvote the contents of any link, comments and accordingly it will rise in popularity. Sadly it misses one key feature - "Search". If you miss a certain article some day then it is very rare that you will find it in first home page again

### Step One
Build a simple search/filter feature for Hacker News. Use the [Official API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and allow to quickly filter by time or popularity

#### Example
Show the top 50 posts from the last month. You can define "top" as any link which has more than 250 points. On a webpage show your search results which has a link to the original article and some basic details about the post - points, date etc

### Step Two
Once you are done with this give an option to save the links which look interesting. Allow for tags and your comments to be saved alongwith the link. If you are adventurous then save your favourite links in the cloud in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/)
